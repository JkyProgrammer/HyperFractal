# HyperFractal

(project info)

## Help & Instructions

Feeling lost? Below is an explanation of the key features of the application.

### Rendering

When you start the application or make changes to parameters such as zoom, equation, centering, etc, you will be shown a low-resolution preview render in the viewport on the left side of the window.

By clicking on the 'Render Image' button in the control panel, the application will then generate a screen-resolution image in the viewport, during which time parameter controls are locked. Rendering progress is shown below the 'Render Image' button.

### Parameters

Parameters determine the image which is output. These include the following:
* Zoom - allows you to look closer at particular areas by stretching the mathematical space on both axes - can be altered using the 'Zoom In', 'Reset Zoom', 'Zoom Out' buttons
* Offset - allows you to move the viewport around the fractal by offsetting the mathematical space on one or more axes - can be altered using the 'up', 'down' 'left', 'right' buttons, or the arrow keys
* Equation - the iterative mathematical expression which is used to generate values for each pixel - typing allows you to alter this: **see dedicated help section**
* Iteration limit - limits the number of times the equation is iterated before the program assumes it does not tend to infinity - can be altered using the '<' and '>' buttons, or using the left and right square bracket keys

### Equations

Fractals are generated by iteratively applying a formula to a complex number and counting the number of times it can be iterated before tending toward infinity.

This count is then used to compute a colour for a given pixel. 

Formulas (also referred to as expressions or equations) are in the format `Z = f(Z, C)`, where `Z` is referring to the iterated value, and `C` is constant. On the first iteration, `Z` and `C` are both initialised to be equal to a complex number, with components `a+bi`. `a` and `b` are the horizonal and vertical coordinates (respectively) of the pixel being computed, meaning each pixel has different initial conditions for computation.

The equation field in the application can handle brackets (`(...)`), indices (`^`), division (`/`), multiplication (`*`), addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`), and processes them in that order. It supports the use of `z` and `c` as basic variables, as well as `x` and `y`, which behave as the real and imaginary part of `z`, and `a` and `b`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of `c`. It also supports the use of numerical (decimal) constants which can be in terms of `i`.

There is no limit to equation length or complexity, but more complex equations are likely to be more computationally expensive and increase render time significantly.

The application also contains a number of equation presets, which can be fun to explore and are good starting points if you want to come up with your own equation.
Presets run much faster than custom entered equations due to them being hard-coded.

When writing your own equations, it is advised to replace `z^2` with `z*z`, as the latter evaluates much faster in a computational environment. The same can be done for any integer power of a function.
In general, _you are advised to simplify your expression to a reasonable extent before entering it into the application, in order to reduce render time_.
