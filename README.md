# HyperFractal

(project info)

## Help & Instructions

Feeling lost? Below is an explanation of the key features of the application.

### Rendering

When you start the application or make changes to parameters such as zoom, equation, centering, etc, you will be shown a low-resolution preview render in the viewport on the left side of the window.

By clicking on the 'Render Image' button in the control panel, the application will then generate a screen-resolution image in the viewport, during which time parameter controls are locked. Rendering progress is shown below the 'Render Image' button.

### Parameters

Parameters determine the image which is output. These include the following:
* Zoom - allows you to look closer at particular areas by stretching the mathematical space on both axes - can be altered using the 'Zoom In', 'Reset Zoom', 'Zoom Out' buttons
* Offset - allows you to move the viewport around the fractal by offsetting the mathematical space on one or more axes - can be altered using the 'up', 'down' 'left', 'right' buttons, or the arrow keys
* Equation - the iterative mathematical expression which is used to generate values for each pixel - typing allows you to alter this **see dedicated help section**
* Iteration limit - limits the number of times the equation is iterated before the program assumes it does not tend to infinity - can be altered using the '<' and '>' buttons, or using the left and right square bracket keys

### Equations

Fractals are generated by iteratively applying a formula to a complex number and counting the number of times it can be iterated before tending toward infinity.

This count is then used to compute a colour for a given pixel. 

Formulas (also referred to as expressions or equations) are in the format `Z = f(Z, C)`, where `Z` is referring to the iterated value, and `C` is constant. On the first iteration, `Z` and `C` are both initialised to be equal to a complex number, with components `a+bi`. `a` and `b` are the horizonal and vertical coordinates (respectively) of the pixel being computed, meaning each pixel has different initial conditions for computation.

The equation field in the application can handle brackets (`(...)`), indices (`^`), division (`/`), multiplication (`*`), addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`), and processes them in that order. It supports the use of `z` and `c` as basic variables, as well as `x` and `y`, which behave as the real and imaginary part of `z`, and `a` and `b`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of `c`. It also supports the use of numerical (decimal) constants which can be in terms of `i`.

There is no limit to equation length or complexity, but more complex equations are likely to be more computationally expensive and increase render time significantly.

The application also contains a number of equation presets, which can be fun to explore and are good starting points if you want to come up with your own equation.
